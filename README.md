Guided Frequencies is a virtual environment built with Three.js to help people relax, practice mindfulness and meditation. It uses PoseNet a machine learning model that uses real-time human pose estimation to allow the user to personalise their experience within the digital environment by controlling a Low-Frequency Oscillator blending and creating harmonies with audio in the scene. 

It also features Quotable API bringing in a random motivational quote into the space allowing for the user to help think positively on arrival to the digital environment. 



The environment helps bring ideas and mindfulness and meditation techniques and to people at home who may suffer social anxiety with going to physical classes as well as those who want a more personalised environment to practice their own mediative and mindfulness techniques.
